## Scripts python
### makepointcloud/makeSnowman.py, makepointcloud/makeNucleii.py, makepointcloud/makeBeads.py
Generate files pointclouds/snowman.pcd, pointclouds/nucleii.pcd, pointclouds/beads.pcd, and the corresponding files metadata/snowman.meta, metadata/nucleii.meta, metadata/beads.meta

Must be run from the project root folder, because paths of output files are given relative to root folder.

### other/comparecsv.py
Very roughly calculate similarity between csv files.

### other/display_scores.py
Display a scatterplot from the text file generated by ../tests/frankwolfe/test_metricisgood.cpp

Each point (c, s) in the scatterplot is the score s = x^T D x of a permutation matrix x obtained by composing c random transpositions (i,j).

D is a matrix that "contains" the vertex similarity matrix and the edge similarity matrix between two graphs, so that x^T D x is the score of permutation x when matching the two graphs. Note that in the expression x^T D x, x is the vector obtained by concatenating all the rows of matrix x. For a more precise description of D, refer to the article by Huang (reference (1) in ../README.md).

The graphs used in ../tests/frankwolfe/test_metricisgood.cpp are two copies of the same graph, the graph generated for ../metadata/big1.meta ; hence the best permutation matrix is the identity matrix (corresponding to c = 0 in the scatterplot).

This scatterplot shows that the objective function x^T D x used for the graph matching algorithm

### other/reorder_sim_matrix.py
Take the similarity matrix between two graphs, plus the permutation matrix resulting from a graph matching algorithm. Apply the permutation to the columns of the similarity matrix to reflect the matching.
